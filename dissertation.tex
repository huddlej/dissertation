% Documentation for University of Washington thesis LaTeX document class
% by Jim Fox
% fox@washington.edu
%
%    Revised 2020/02/24, added \caption()[]{} option.  No ToC.
%
%    Revised for version 2015/03/03 of uwthesis.cls
%    Revised, 2016/11/22, for cleanup of sample copyright and title pages
%
%    This document is contained in a single file ONLY because
%    I wanted to be able to distribute it easily.  A real thesis ought
%    to be contained on many files (e.g., one for each chapter, at least).
%
%    To help you identify the files and sections in this large file
%    I use the string '==========' to identify new files.
%
%    To help you ignore the unusual things I do with this sample document
%    I try to use the notation
%       
%    % --- sample stuff only -----
%    special stuff for my document, but you don't need it in your thesis
%    % --- end-of-sample-stuff ---


%    Printed in twoside style now that that's allowed
