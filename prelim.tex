     Thank you to Dr.\ Trevor Bedford for giving me the opportunity to work on challenging projects and the time and support to find my way through them.
     Thank you to my committee for guiding my research and career in the right direction when I was stuck in the weeds.
     Thank you to my excellent lab mates and collaborators for your constant examples of how to be excellent scientists and humans with humor and humility.
     I could not have done this without you all.
